## Misconfigured Google Maps API Key Hardcoded
Google Maps API Keys are designed to be public and have no impact on confidentiality/integrity of customer data.
However, if these keys are exposed and do not have some recommended security settings that restrict/limit the use of queries to block misuse, attackers may be able to generate a financial impact by carrying out massive queries with the keys.

-> Check whether it is possible to misuse the keys and their permissions with it.
