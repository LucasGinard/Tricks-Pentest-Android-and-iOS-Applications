# Open Source Projects for Protections in Mobile Apps
It is better to opt for paid market protections that offer a higher level of security and maintainability.
The open source projects that I see the most promise are marked with (+), but remember that there is no magic solution, there are many ways around them.
When customizations are made to these projects, protection becomes more efficient.
Bear in mind that when we talk about implementing protections in mobile apps, we are talking about putting barriers to make it difficult for an attacker to interact, find exploits in the services consumed by the app, that's all.
