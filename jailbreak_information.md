# Jailbreak Information
## Jailbreak Types (Untethered, Semi-Untethered, Semi-Tethered, Tethered)
### Untethered
In this type of Jailbreak, you only need to run the exploit once, not losing the jailbreak after restarting or turning off the device. However, this type of jailbreak is only possible on lower versions of iOS, and a new unrestricted jailbreak has not been released for a long time.

Below are some program options that perform this type of Untethered Jailbreak:

-> JailbreakMe: IOS 4.x

-> Absinthe: IOS 5.x

-> evasi0n: IOS 6.x - 7.x

-> PanGu9: IOS 9.2 - 9.3.3 

### Semi-Untethered
Requires an exploit to be run every time you restart or shut down the device to perform the Jailbreak, semi-unrestricted jailbreaks have been the most popular type of Jailbreak today.  
Below are some tools for performing Semi-Untethered Jailbreak:  
-> Odyssey  
https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-odyssey/  
The tool is compatible with iOS versions from 13.0 to 13.7.

-> Taurine  
https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-taurine/  
Is supported on iOS versions 14.0 to 14.8.1.

-> Dopamine  
https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-dopamine/  
Dopamine only supports A12 and newer devices on iOS 15.0 to 15.4.1.

### Semi-Tethered 
Requires an exploit to be run every time you restart or shut down the device to perform Jailbreak. These are very similar to semi-untethered jailbreaks, however, the exploit must be performed using a computer rather than a loaded application. This is the most common type of Jailbreak used at the moment.  
Below are some tools for performing Semi-Tethered Jailbreak:

-> Checkra1n  
https://checkra.in/  
Checkra1n is a community project based on the 'checkm8' bootrom exploit that works perfectly on iOS 12.x - 14.x.

-> Palera1n  
https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-palera1n/  
palera1n is an iOS 15.x-16.x jailbreak for devices, based on the checkm8 exploit.  
On Windows, you must use palen1x.

-> Jailbreak with 3utools - Dopamine  
Rootless Jailbreak for iOS 15.0 - 16.5.1 (arm64e) and iOS 15.0 - 16.6.1 (arm64), provides a good choice of jailbreak hiding method

### Tethered
The device is modified in a way that requires PC booting, even without jailbreaking the device. It's only useful for a specific audience, like jailbreak developers themselves.  
Below are some tools for performing Tethered Jailbreak:  
-> Blackra1n  
Supported iOS 3.x up to iOS 4.x.

-> Redsn0w  
Covered a range of older iOS versions, including iOS 3.x, iOS 4.x, and some versions of iOS 5.x.

## Jailbreak Methods (Rootful, Rootless)
### Rootless Jailbreak
-> The rootless jailbreak stores all data and files in a directory that you can access, usually /var/jb, which is a completely fixed path. It allows the execution of unauthorized applications, theme modifications, user interface customizations and other tweaks that do not directly affect the main operating system located in the root / directory. By limiting modifications to /var/jb, it is safer and less intrusive, as it does not directly alter the operating system core in the root directory /.

-> The main advantage of using rootless is that it is easier to revert changes and mainly that this method makes it more difficult to detect Jailbreak by applications that have Anti-Jailbreak protection implemented.

-> With the use of rootless there is a possibility of incompatibility in some repositories and adjustments that need to be updated to support it, however this is something that occurs less and less frequently.

### Rootful Jailbreak
-> A "rootful" jailbreak allows modifications to the main operating system, specifically the root/ directory. This grants full superuser (root) access to the system, enabling deep modifications that directly affect the main operating system located in the root/ directory.

## Communicating with your Jailbroken Device
Having a local SSH server is crucial to performing penetration testing on jailbroken mobile devices in a secure and controlled manner. SSH provides an encrypted connection for remote access, allowing you to execute commands on the device terminal from a controlled environment. This makes it easy to scan for vulnerabilities, security exploits, and in-depth analysis.

-> Install openssh in Sileo  

-> If you want to interact with the shell on your iPhone, you can install NewTerm3 through Sileo.  
The users of your jailbroken device are usually root and mobile;  
The default password is alpine;  
The default port is 22 for the SSH server.
