# Magisk Tricks
Magisk is a "rooting" tool for Android devices that provides superuser access without permanently modifying the system, using the "systemless root" technique. Additionally, it provides MagiskHide, hiding the root of specific applications, and supports a variety of devices. In addition to root, Magisk offers additional modules or plugins that add extra functionality to the device, allowing users to modify the system and add personalized features in a flexible and secure way. However, its use may affect the device's warranty.

## Root AVD with Magisk - Emulated Environment
### Windows

```

### Linux
